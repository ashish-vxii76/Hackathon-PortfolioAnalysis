## Introduction
The Portfolio Analysis and Management App is a comprehensive tool designed to assist users in managing their stock portfolios with advanced data analysis, sentiment integration, predictive modeling, and visualization capabilities. It provides insights into stock performance, market sentiment, and portfolio optimization, making it easier for users to make informed investment decisions.

## Features
- **Historical Data Collection**: Download and store historical stock data.
- **Incremental Data Updates**: Automate daily updates of stock prices.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Integrate sentiment scores derived from social media and news sources.
- **Prediction Model**: Forecast stock prices using machine learning models.
- **Portfolio Analysis**: Analyze and optimize portfolio performance using key financial metrics.
- **User Interface**: Interactive dashboard and tools for portfolio management.
- **API Integration**: Secure API endpoints for data access and updates.

## Architecture
The app is built using a combination of Python, SQL, NoSQL, React.js, and various APIs. The architecture is modular, with separate components for data sourcing, sentiment analysis, predictive modeling, and the user interface.

## Usage
- **Dashboard**: View overall portfolio performance and individual stock analytics.
- **Sentiment Trends**: Analyze the sentiment trends for specific stocks.
- **Predictions**: View predicted stock prices and make informed decisions.
- **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Use the drag-and-drop tool for portfolio optimization.

## Data Sourcing and Management
- **Historical Data Collection**: The app fetches 5-10 years of historical stock data from the NASDAQ API and stores it in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Incremental Data Sourcing**: A cron job is set up to fetch daily updates, validate tickers, and log any discrepancies.

## Sentiment Analysis
- **Data Collection**: Text data is collected from Twitter, financial news, and Reddit, stored in MongoDB.
- **Text Processing**: Sentiment scores are calculated using tools like NLTK or spaCy, with VADER for sentiment scoring.
- **Integration**: Sentiment scores are stored alongside price data for correlation analysis.

## Prediction Model
- **Feature Engineering**: Combines historical prices, trading volumes, and sentiment scores.
- **Modeling**: Uses Random Forest or LSTM for price predictions.
- **Evaluation**: Performance is evaluated using MAE and RMSE metrics.

## Portfolio Analysis
- **Metrics**: Calculates CAGR, volatility, and Sharpe ratio.
- **Optimization**: Implements MPT and Monte Carlo simulations for asset allocation.

## User Interface
- **Dashboard**: Built with React.js, featuring interactive charts (Chart.js, D3.js) and tools for portfolio management.
- **Detailed Views**: Graphs for stock prices, sentiment trends, and predictive analytics.

## Backend and API Integration
- **API Development**: RESTful APIs built with Flask/Django, integrated with OAuth for secure third-party access.
- **Performance Optimization**: Uses Redis for caching and optimized database queries.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Unit Testing**: Scripts and models are tested using pytest.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensures seamless interaction between components.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Feedback is gathered from beta users to refine the app.

## Deployment
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy on AWS or Azure using EC2, RDS, and S3.
- **Monitoring**: Use AWS CloudWatch and the ELK stack for performance monitoring and logging.

## User Training and Documentation
- **User Guides**: Detailed guides and walkthroughs are available.
- **Support**: A helpdesk is available via email or a chatbot for user assistance.

## Feedback and Iteration
- **Collect Feedback**: Use in-app surveys and Google Analytics.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Iterate on features based on user feedback and market trends.
